# The Pareto Rule in Machine Learning, Python Libraries

After being immersed in Data Science for several months, I already have a better understanding of the global environment, and the necessary skills as a Machine Learning engineer. It's just that sometimes I get imposter syndrome, and I start asking questions: Am I good enough? Can I really add value to the company I work for? Am I able to perform the tasks that are left to me?
Many more questions, and this is why I decided to do this project.

The Pareto Rule, also known as the 80/20 principle, is an empirical observation that states that approximately 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This rule is applied in a variety of contexts and fields, and is used to highlight how a minority of items or factors often have a significantly greater impact than the majority.

So, I will use this rule in some of the fields as a ML engeener. The chosed language, with greater potential for growth and profit, is Python. The libraries where I will use this project, is going to be: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, SQLite, Github, Terminal, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and Python as well.
